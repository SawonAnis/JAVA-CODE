Abstract Class

1. A method without implementation/body is known as abstract method.
2. A method must always be declared in an abstract class or we can say that 
is a class has an abstract method , it should be declared abstract as well.
3. If a regular class extends an abstract class then the class must have to 
implement all the abstract methods of abstract parent class or it has to be 
declared abstract as well.
4. Abstract methods in an abstract class are meant to be overriden in derived
concrete classes otherwise compile time error will be thrown.
